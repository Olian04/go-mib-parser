# Project goal

This project is a library written in GO that implements a minimal `ASN.1` parser specifically designed for parsing SNMP MIB files.

## Project Terms

* ASN.1 = Abstract Syntax Notation One. This is the standard syntax for defining serializable data structures that MIB files are written in.
* MIB = Management information base. These are collections of OIDs along with metadata regarding these OIDs, such as name, data type, description, possible values, as well as other OIDs which are children to the current OID.
* OID = Object identifier. These are unique strings of numbers separated by `.` characters. Each unique string represents a single unique OID in a one-to-one relationship. Each number in the `.` separated sequence represents a parent OID in the chain of OIDs leading to the one identified by the full sequence of numbers. For example, the OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.343` translates to the following:

```text
1 ISO
1.3 identified-organization (ISO/IEC 6523),
1.3.6 DoD,
1.3.6.1 internet,
1.3.6.1.4 private,
1.3.6.1.4.1 IANA enterprise numbers,
1.3.6.1.4.1.343 Intel Corporation
```

## Project structure

* All code should be written in go.
* Any source code files that are to be part of the top level API of the library should be put in the root of the project and should use the package name `mib_parser`
* Any source code files that are implementation details should be grouped in directories based on their area of focus. (For example `tokenizer`, `lexer`, `linker`, etc). These grouped files should use the package name equal to the directory name.
* Any files used for testing the source code should be put in `tests/`.
* The directory `mibs/` is pre populated by correctly MIB files and should not be changed. You are supposed to used these files in your tests in order to verify that the library is working correctly.
